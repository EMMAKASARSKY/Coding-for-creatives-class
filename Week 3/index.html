	<h1>Hi! My name is Emma. </h1>

	 <p>I need to love what I do. It is as simple as that. In 2014, Forbes Magazine released the statistic that 52.3% of Americans are unhappy at work. I have never been able to imagine myself adhered to a cubicle from 9-5, eyes darting between the clock and an excel spread sheet until 5pm reluctantly arrived. I need to be immersed in my work. I want the day to fly by. Simply put, I do not want my work to feel like work. Over time, I have discovered that when I utilize my creative thinking, problem solving, and artistic ability, I am able to emphasize my best self. Creative advertising enables me to unite attributes that actually enhance my personal being while also promoting a long, successful, (and happy) career trajectory. 

	<p> Advertising had always been an interest of mine, but after  working at Ogilvy, I saw this interest transform into a passion. I worked as part of the Tiffany and Co. Account Management Team, where the hours, and days, flew by as I would follow my supervisor up and down the stairs, run from department to department, hail cabs to and from the Tiffany office, and partake in meeting after meeting. Although I was sometimes envious of other interns who enjoyed their full hour lunch break or socialized at the end of the workday, I was working non-stop- and I loved every minute of it. However, the creative side of me was was still unfulfilled. I became alive when I sat in on creative meetings- I never wanted to leave the 10th and 11th floors. I was determined to discover how these creatives obtained such incredible positions, and figure out how I would get there myself. I linked-in stalked, sent impromptu emails, scheduled meetings with higher-ups, including the company CEO. I was fearless and I was committed. All roads began pointing to Miami Ad School.

	<p> Despite Miami Ad School as the obvious choice, it took me a year to finally commit to the program. As an idealistic and naive twenty-one year old, I had imagined myself graduating from college, moving in to a beautiful doorman apartment, finding a good-looking boyfriend, having time to stay fit, party on the weekends,  AND THEN figure out my job.  Clearly, as we all know, this is not realistic. What I have reluctantly accepted, though, is that success takes time to build. It requires hard work, commitment, and devotion. So, instead of finding a job in finance or consulting, where I could have quickly attained these other “life goals”, I am here instead. I am living at home, commuting to school, and drowning in student debt. But, I am happy. I am in the right place, and I am committed to my future. I could not be more excited to see what lies down the road. 

	<p>I have no experience with coding, except that my roommate in college was an engineer. I always saw her doing work like this- I never thought it would be me!!!
